### 💻 Mentoria Formulário

The challenge is to build a web page from scratch using the prototype layout
available on figma, strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS in applying concepts
and what was observed in previous Stage 2 projects and Stage 3 classes on building 
a form, validating the fields.
I challenged myself to apply concepts in the web page navigation bar and footer, 
which originally did not have in the figma prototype.

What was developed:

- I challenged myself when creating the navigation bar and footer;
- Grouping fields with fieldset and legend;
- Formatting the text field;
- Validating fields and submitting forms;
- Position of elements on the screen;
- Import external CSS file into the project;
- Applying custom fonts (typography) in the CSS file and starting the external CSS;
- Validation of fields with CSS;
- CSS variables;
- Working with colors and fonts;
- Aligning and positioning texts and elements;
- Applying the spacing;
- Borders and element classifications;
- The CSS Box Model concept;
- Hover effect on HTML elements of links and buttons;
- Reset CSS removing possible inconsistencies between different browsers;
- Project file system structure separated by folder;


I applied my knowledge of the Explorer from Rocketseat concepts in a practical way 
to this project, with the lessons:

- Introduction to HTML and CSS;
- Getting to know new concepts of HTML and CSS;
- Forms, Validations and Customizations;
